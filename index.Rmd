I like to play with data to answer research questions and test hypotheses. Currently I investigate questions related to batch effects and its normalization in gastric cancer in The Cancer Genome Atlas Program as a Research Assisstant at [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org/departments/epidemiology-biostatistics) in the department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics. 

I graduated from the [University of Iowa](https://www.uiowa.edu/) with a BS in [Statistics](https://www.stat.uiowa.edu/) and a BA in [Japanese](https://www.asian-slavic.uiowa.edu/undergraduate-programs/japanese) in 2018. In 2019 I began working toward my MS in Biostatistics at [Columbia University](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/become-student/departments/biostatistics), where I am investigating statistical methods for genetics and other health related fields under the advisement of [Dr. Prakash Gorroochurn](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/pg2113) at Columbia University and [Dr. Li-xuan Qin](https://www.mskcc.org/profile/li-xuan-qin) at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. I expect to graduate by May 2021.
