### Welcome to the personal page of Jingyi Tang!

I am a M.S. candidate in Biostatistics field with a specific interest in cancer genetics studies. Currently, my investigate questions are related to **handling effects** and the **normalization methods** in gastric cancer in The Cancer Genome Atlas Program.

I graduated from the [University of Iowa](https://www.uiowa.edu/) with a BS in [Statistics](https://www.stat.uiowa.edu/) and a BA in [Japanese](https://www.asian-slavic.uiowa.edu/undergraduate-programs/japanese) in 2018. In 2019, I began working toward my M.S. degree in Biostatistics at [Columbia University](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/become-student/departments/biostatistics), where I am investigating statistical methods for genetics and other health related fields under the advisement of [Dr. Prakash Gorroochurn](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/pg2113) at Columbia University and [Dr. Li-xuan Qin](https://www.mskcc.org/profile/li-xuan-qin) at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. I expect to graduate by May 2021.
