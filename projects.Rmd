## **TEAM PROJECT**  

***

### **Exploring Vague Priors on a Variance Component in an LME Model**

* Followed up with Brain Smithâ€™s research on PET images of cancer patient neck and head to investigate the influence of vague priors and the problem of how operators affect the average of the measurements
* Programmed and test ran in OpenBUGS and R with different priors for the variance component
* Present the findings in the form of an oral presentation and a written report 

***

### **Epigenome-wide Association Studies between DNA Methylation and Gastric Adenocarcinoma**

* Tidied and prepared data from The Cancer Genome Atlas database  on Gastric Adenocarcinoma
* Programmed in R using methods such as Principle Component Analysis to filter noise covariates, K-means Clustering to identify population substructure and association test to explore genes that associate with the onset of gastric cancer
* Used RMardown to draw conclusions based on the numerical results, deliver the result in visual aids, and interpreted the findings in the project to write a written report
